# Gather Music

### __Bringing people together through love of concert-going!__

Gather Music is a platform built on the premise of bringing concert & festival goers closer together, through creating dedicated pages for musical events and messaging with others who are also interested or attending.

On Gather Music, a user is asked to log into the landing page and after doing so, they will have the ability to create a page for a given event, which can have the event's venue, city, date & performers added to it. 

After the event page has been created, the user and other signed in users can also access the page to be able to post messages for interaction with others.
The user will also be able to delete and edit the event as well, as long as they were the one who created it.

All users will have the ability to search for an event by the city it is taking place in as well with the "Search by City" feature. This will allow them to easily access the page, so they are able to find a given event much quicker in the process.
